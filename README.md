# Cookiecutter PyPackage

[![Test](https://github.com/yukihiko-shinoda/cookiecutter-pypackage/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yukihiko-shinoda/cookiecutter-pypackage/actions?query=workflow%3ATest)

[Cookiecutter] template for a Python package, forked from [briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage].

- Documentation: [https://yukihiko-shinoda.github.io/docs-cookiecutter-pypackage/](https://yukihiko-shinoda.github.io/docs-cookiecutter-pypackage/)

## Features

This template focus following:

- Target Python version: 3.5 - 3.8
- Dependency tracking using [Pipenv]
- Linting provided by both [pylint], [flake8], [mypy] [executed by GitHub Actions]
- Formatting provided by [isort], [pipenv-setup], [black] [checked by GitHub Actions]
- Analizing complexity and maintainability provided by [radon], [xenon] [checked by GitHub Actions]
- All development tasks (lint, format, analize, test, etc) excluding deployment wrapped up in a python CLI by [invoke]
- Omit documentation workflows
  since this project targets early stages of development.
  In the early stages of development it is better to focus on providing
  working software and writing README.md than providing comprehensive
  documentation.

  @see [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html)

## Quickstart

1\.

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

```console
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

2\.

Generate a Python package project:

```console
cookiecutter https://github.com/yukihiko-shinoda/cookiecutter-pypackage.git --checkout master-yukihiko-shinoda
```

Then, you will interactively prompt some choices of templated values,
for detail of templated values, see the [Prompts].

Then initialized project direcotry is created in current directory.

## Points to review after creating initialized project directory

1\.
Review support range if the one of your package is not Python 3.5 - 3.8

- .github/workflows/test.yml
- setup.py
  - python_requires
  - classifiers
- docs/CONTRIBUTING.md -> Get Started! -> 5. oldest Python version

2\.

Pin wheel version in Pipfle and execute `pipenv lock`
if you prefer stability of deployment task.

## Remaining task after creating initialized project directory

1\.

Commit and push to GitHub repository.

2\.

Activate your created repository on [Code Climate] and copy and paste badge.

2-1\.

Copy "TEST REPORTER ID" from \[Test Coverages\]

2-2\.

register copied TEST REPORTER ID into secret in your pushed GitHub repository
as name "CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID".

3\.

Activate your created repository on [pyup.io].

Create a new account at [pyup.io] or log into your existing account.

Click on the green `Add Repo` button in the top left corner
and select repository you created in Step 1.
A popup will ask you whether you want to pin your dependencies.
Click on `Pin` to add the repo.

Once your repo is set up correctly,
the pyup.io badge will show your current update status.

4\.

Issue API token at [PyPI] and register into secret of your GitHub repository
as name `pypi_password`

5\.

Create tag `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` and push to GitHub repository
to deploy into [PyPI].

Then, get your code on! ðŸ˜Ž
Add your package dependencies to your pipenv with `pipenv install`.
