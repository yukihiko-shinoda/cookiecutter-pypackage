## Quickstart

```

Generate a Python package project:

```console
cookiecutter https://github.com/briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
```

Then:

- Create a repo and put it there.
- Add the repo to your [Travis-CI] account.
- Install the dev requirements into a virtualenv. (`pipenv install --dev`)
- [Register] your project with PyPI.
- Run the Travis CLI command `travis encrypt --add deploy.password` to encrypt your PyPI password in Travis config
  and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master branch.
- Add the repo to your [Read the Docs] account + turn on the Read the Docs service hook.
- Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
- Get your code on! ðŸ˜Ž Add your package dependencies to your setup.py as you go, and lock them into your virtual environment with `pipenv install`.
- Activate your project on [pyup.io].
